    "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the target or response variable) and a single independent variable (also known as the predictor or feature variable). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and aims to find the best-fitting line (linear equation) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n",
